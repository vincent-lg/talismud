"""Account entity.

An account plays the role of an intermediate between a connection
from a player (a session object), and one or more characters.  The
account contains the username, hashed password and email address of
the player.  One or more characters can be gathered in the same account.
Even if you plan to have only one character per account, this separation
is useful (no need to put passwords in characters, after all).
