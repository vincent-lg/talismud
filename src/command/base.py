    """
    Base class for commands.

    Static commands are mostly defined and dynamically imported
    from the file system, from the 'command' directory and its
    sub-directories.

    A static command can have a name, inferred from the class
    name if not provided.  It can also have aliases, a command
    category and basic command permissions.  It's help entry is
    inferred from the command's docstring.

    Here's a very basic example.  Assuming you want to add the 'look'
    command, just create a file with the '.py' extension in the command
    package (it can be in a sub-package, for the sake of organization).

    ```python
    from command import Command, CommandArgs

    class Look(Command): # 'look' (lowercase class name) will be the name

        '''
        Look command, to look around you.

        Syntax:
            look [object]

        This command is used to look around you or look a specific object
        more in details.

        '''

        # If you're not happy with the default name, just provide a
        # class variable 'name' and set the command name to it.  You can
        # define the category in the 'category' class variable as a
        # string, and the command permissions, still as a string, in the
        # 'permissions' class variable.  If they're not defined,
        # these last two values will be searched in parent packages
        # following a capitalized convention (see below).
        args = CommandArgs()
        args.add_argument("object", optional=True)

        async def run(self, args):
            '''The command is executed.'''
            await self.msg("Ho, look!")
    ```

    If the `category` and/or `permissions` class variable aren't
    provided, they're automatically searched in the module and
    parent packages.  A `CATEGORY` variable is searched in this module
    and, if not found, in parent packages recursively.  Similarly,
    a `PERMISSIONS` variable is searched in the module and parent
    packages.  This system allows to easily organize commands.

    For instance, assuming you want to create commands that only the
    administrators should use:  you could create a directory called
    'admin' inside of the 'command' package.  In this new directory,
    add an `__init__.py` file.  Inside write the following:

    ```python
    CATEGORY = "Admin commands"
    PERMISSIONS = "admin"
    ```

    Then you can create a file per command as usual.  For instance,
    create a file 'services.py' that contains the following code:

    ```python
    from command import Command, CommandArgs

    class Services(Command):

        '''Command services, to look for active services in the game.'''

        # name will be 'services'
        # ...
    ```

    Because we haven't defined a `category` class variable, a
    `CATEGORY` top-level variable will be searched in the module
    itself.  Since we haven't defined one, it will be searched in the
    parent package (that is, in our 'command/admin/__init.py' file).
    In this file is our `CATEGORY` variable, so the 'services'
    command will have its category set to 'Admin commands'.  The same
    process applies for permissions.  Notice that you can always
    override this behavior should the need arise, but it makes
    organization much easier.
