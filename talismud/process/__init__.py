"""Separate processes in TalisMUD.

Each process is kept in a separate file.  A process, as its name suggests,
is run in an independent process.  Synchronization between processes
is achieved though a basic TcP exchange of commands and answers.  Commands
can be broadcasted to everyone listening on this small TCP server, or
addressed to one single process.

Defined modules:
    game: the game process wich can restart on a frequent basis.
    portal: the portal process, which should be running all the time.
